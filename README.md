# IMI-StoryWriter
Notepad, but you can export to word + Dark mode for the Windows 10 users

## Why?
I write some stories for fun/hobby, and I usually write on Google Docs, and do some final formatting on MS-Word before sending to print. The issue is my old version of word does not have dark mode, and Google Docs need's internet.

So I built my own Notepad clone, without the menubar. It is inspired from Office 365 (the top bit), but since I could not get any formatting to work, it is very barebones. You can *undo/redo*, and **letter/word count** at the bottom

## Features
- Dark Mode
- Minimal (since no features) UI
- Very basic, and non distracting
- No formatting except Heading and Subtitle (l1, l2)

## Limitations
- No formatting
- You need to remove the \n lines on word
- Its a very basic notepad, but no SAVE even, only SAVE AS
