# IMI-StoryWriter
A simple Python Script, that produces an GUI similar to notepad,
but you can export and open word files, add headings, and use dark mode

## Why?
As an human language model, I sometimes write stories, when my brain proompts my brain to create a story. I usually write on GDocs, with a extension called _docsafterdark_, since my old Word 2016 was not good enough to have dark mode.

So, as any reaonable person would, instead of getting a later version of Word, or using Google Docs, I decided to make a __ultra basic word processor__. It cannot do any formatting such as _color, fonts, bold/italic/underline, shapes, etc._ All it can do is set headings. But unlike Notepad, it can export and open Word documents!! 

You have title, and headings all from 1-4 or 5 i think. It is very basic, but works.

## Features
- Dark Mode and Light mode (prefernces)
- Minimal (since no features) UI
- Very basic, and non distracting
- Auto paragraph adding!!!
- No formatting except Heading and Subtitle (l1, l2)
- Export/Import Word documents

## Limitations
- No formatting (bold/italic/underline are overrated)
- Its a very basic notepad, but no SAVE even, only SAVE AS
